# mFSTSP – ALNS-SA (Chen & Guo, 2025)

This repository provides a full Python implementation of the
two-stage ALNS–SA algorithm proposed in:

Chen, S.-Z., Guo, R.-Y. (2025)
A two-stage metaheuristic algorithm for the multi-drops flying sidekick traveling salesman problem
Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 97, 102001.

Implemented algorithms:
- Algorithm 1: ALNS-SA for TSP
- Algorithm 2: Route segmentation
- Algorithm 3: Improved simulated annealing for node allocation

The implementation strictly follows the pseudo-codes and equations
presented in the paper.
